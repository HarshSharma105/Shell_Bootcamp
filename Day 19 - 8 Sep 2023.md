- Creating a SQL Database resource with Azure's Sample Adventure Works LT Dataset.
- Creating a Gen2 Storage account
- Creating a Data Factory
- Creating a Linked Service for Azure SQL DB Source.
- Using Lookup activity to get table names as array variable for giving to for each to process.
	- select * from information_schema.tables where table_schema = 'salesLT';
- We will need following Data sets: one for Lookup to DB, one for Copy Data Activity, one for Gen2 output storage.
- Creating a copy data activity inside a forEach activity with source as DS_CopyDataActivity and sink as DS_destination_gen2.
- Parameterising the copy data activity Data Set with two parameters: schema_param and table_param which we can parse(json) from output of lookup activity.

### Change Data Capture (CDC):
- identify and capture changes made to source data
- helps maintain data synchronization between source and target systems
- Saves Time, Computing, Resources by updating only
- Full Load, and Incremental Load
- **Schema Drift** : Changes in the structure or schema of the source data that occur after the initial schema has been defined and CDC processes have been set up. These changes can include additions, deletions, or modifications of columns, data types, or table structures in the source data.
- Creating a data flow activity with source as SQL database and sink as gen2 storage, and setting the CDC setting 'on'.
### Automation Accounts:
- Contains runbooks (instructions/scripts)
- Runbooks can contain shell scripts, power shell scripts, python scripts
- Runbook types: PowerShell, Python, PowerShell Workflow, Graphical PowerShell, Graphical PowerShell Workflow.

- ### Azure Monitor:
- Monitor Resources
- Creating Alerts
