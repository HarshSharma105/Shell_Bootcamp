- Creating a Gen2 storage in azure portal
- SAS (shared access signature): for some temporary duration eg: 30 minutes.
- ACL: for giving permanent access.
- generating SAS and connection strings for every service selected.
- can generate file level SAS token
- Access keys: lifetime access ( made time bounded using secret's activation and expiry) to storage account
- Azure key vault (like aws kms) for managing keys.
- Creating Azure key vault service (with vault access policy).
- key vault objects: keys, secrets and certificates.
- Creating a secret in the key vault for generated key.
- IAM (Identity and Access Management) for Access Control: can check access and create roles to provide and deny access.
## Azure Data Factory
- muda muda muda muda muda , muda: actually not useless
- for data flow activities : Data Orchestration
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Jobs
- ELT (Extract, Load and then Transform) jobs
- ADF Used for Extraction, Loading, and Basic Transformation
- ADB (Azure Data Bricks) : used for complex transformations
- ADF Components: Pipelines, Activities, Datasets, Linked Services, Integration Runtime, Triggers, Data Flow.
- Pipeline: one or more activities
- Source => ADF => Destination
- Azure supports more than 200 source and destinations.
- IR (Integration Runtime): Acts as a bridge for communication between source and ADF or ADF and destination - for every source and destination *"type"* needs a different IR.
- Using IR we can only give access/authorisation to higher level eg: machine access/server access.
- Linked Service: for accessing data base level access eg: D:// drive in a server
- Data Sets: for accessing table level access. eg: a file in a drive on a server
- Server => IR, Accounts => LS, Table => DS
- #### IR Types: 
	- Azure Auto Resolved Integration Runtime (default) - for all azure sources
	- S.H. (Self Hosted Integration Runtime) - if data present on On-premises servers (privately owned), Even if source/destination present on cloud but are in a Virtual network than also we will use SHIR.
	- Azure SSIS (SQL Server Integration Sever) - if we want to use an already existing SSIS package
- Parameterisation: Creating a generic code/pipeline/service which can reused by just changing the name/value of the end file/source/destination.
- Pipeline level parameter and 
- #### Copy Activity:
	- To Copy data among data stores located on-premises and in the cloud.
	- can also be used to publish transformation and analysis results for BI and application consumption.
	- Timeout: set an interval after which the copy activity will stop its execution => will fail
	- Retry : number of times to retry the copy activity 
	- Retry Interval: time interval after which to start copy activity.
	- DIU (data integration unit): unit in which the account will be charged based on the usage.
	- degree of parallelism
