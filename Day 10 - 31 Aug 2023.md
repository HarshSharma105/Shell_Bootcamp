- ### Azure SQL:
	- Creating a new resource
	- Three types of resources: SQL databases, SQL managed instances, SQL Virtual machines
	- SQL Database: single database, elastic database (scalable within single resource pool limit), database server.
	- configuring the azure sql database and server.
	- connected to azure sql database.
	- ran `select getdate()` query.
	- creating views. use case: sharing need to know basis info (not red data) with others (testing team)
	- DDL(definition: create, drop), DML(manipulation: insert, update, delete), DCL(control: grant, revoke)
	- schema: logical grouping of related data. Default schema: DBO. `create schema schema_name`
	- a database can have two tables with same name if they have different schemas and you access them using their respective schema identifier. eg: vend1.vendor, vend2.vendor
	- Drop table: delete table record as well as structure.
	- Delete table : delete table's one or more records. (used with where clause)
	- Truncate table: delete all the records in the table, not its structure.
	- Constraints: Key constraints, non null, check, default, etc.
	- Creating library database in Azure SQL database.
	- Writing sql queries like insert, alter, update, default constraint, group by, having, grant, revoke
	- We have to drop constraints first before dropping columns.
