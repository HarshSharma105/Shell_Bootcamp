- Types of keys: primary, candidate, foreign key, super key, unique key

Normalisation:
- 1NF : no multivalued columns
- 2NF: 1NF, no partial dependency (any non key attribute shouldn't be dependent on partial of a candidate key/complex key)
- 3NF: 2NF, non key attribute shouldn't be dependent on another non key attribute (transitive dependency)
- 3.5NF/BCNF: 3NF, no functional dependency ()

### Dimension Modeling
- Star Schema
- Snowflake Schema

### Slowly Changing Dimension

- SCD-1 : Replace current value with new value
- SCD-2: Adding new row to maintain history. For Ex: Adding new columns like Maintaining `Effective from` and `Effective to` date along with `Current Flag`, and then adding new row with changed value.
- SCD-3: If a value change is required in any cell of a column we will Add a new column (called updated/changed/new + old column name) if its the first time we are updating that column. Leads to changing schema if a cell is updated and its related column is not yet updated.
