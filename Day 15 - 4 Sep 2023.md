# Azure Storage
- Create Azure Storage Account
- BLOB : Binary Large Object
- PREMIUM Account types: Block blob(high transaction rates/low storage latency), File Share (Enterprise or high performance applications that need to scale), Page Blobs (Random read write)
- Redundancy: LRS (Locally redundant: more than one copy in single Data Centre), GRS (Geo-redundant : Locally redundant in region pair/Geo-replication, secondary region for reading only and primary region for writing only), ZRS (Zone-redundant : Different copies in different Availability zones), GZRS (Geo-zone-redundant : Zone redundant in Region pair)
- GA : General Availability
- Preview: not in GA
- SFTP: Secure File Transfer Protocol
- Hierarchical namespace
- Cross Tenant replication: Allowing object replication across different AAD (Azure active directory) / Tenant IDs.
- Tenant ID: Every subscription will have a unique tenant ID.
- Access Tiers: (Hot): Store Cost High/ Accessing Cost Low, (Cool: 30 days, Cold: 90 days): Store Cost Low/ Accessing Cost High, (Achieve): Store Cost very low compared to Cold Tier/ Accessing Cost higher compared to Cold Tier
- #### ADLS Gen2 (Azure data lake storage Gen2):
	- Advantage over blobs: 
		- Proper File Hierarchy/Hierarchical name spacing (folder structure)
		- Accelerates big data analytics workloads
		- Enable ACLs (Access Control Lists)
- ### Azure File Sharing:
	- Creating a VM
	- Creating a File share and connecting that with the VM by putting the Connect script in the VMs power shell.
	- Add/Upload File to the file share folder, can be accessed in the VM
	- taking snapshots (using them files can be restored)
	- snapshots contains all the files in the file share folder at the time of  taking the snapshot.
- ### Azure Tables
	- Creating Table
	- Going to storage browser then adding Partition and Row key values
- Azure Pricing Calculator
- TCO (Total cost Ownership) Calculator
- Ingress (Pushing data into Azure): takes less cost, or Egress (Taking data out of Azure): takes  more cost
- Comparing blob and Gen2 costing.
- ### Static Website Hosting
	- Enabled static website.
	- Added index file (html) in the $web folder in container
	- Added the name of index file in static website section
	- pasted the static website url in new tab to preview it.
